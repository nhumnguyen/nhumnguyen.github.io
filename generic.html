								<h2>Software Engineer Intern</h2>
								<p> I worked as a full stack developer for Data Experience team at PagerDuty, a company located in San Francisco, CA.

									<br />My duties:

									<br /> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Developed new core features to group alerts into incidents, including Time Based Alert Grouping and Intelligent Alert Grouping.

									<br /> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Built the new UI model that simplifies the process of moving alerts into a new incident and improves user experience.

<br /> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Refactored the frontend code to make it reusable and maintainable (Ember.JS, Handlebars, JavaScript, CSS, HTML).

<br /> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Developed a new internal tool from front to back to collect data from PD’s engineers and show the according analytics, which required for an upcoming PD’s feature. This tool eliminates the process of collecting data manually and speed up the preparing process (Flask, Python, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Google Charts, PagerDuty’s API).

								<h2>Macy’s System and Technology (GA)</h2>
								<p>
									<br /> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Implemented the new Buy Online Pickup in Store (BOPS) Locker Services, which manages the validation and distribution of online orders to different locker locations for customers to pick up. Implemented using Java, Restful Web Service, SQL, Spring Framework.

<br /> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Developed a Database Management tool - a desktop application which helps the process of creating and updating database easier by auto saving and loading scripts from different versions of database. Implemented using C#, Visual Studio, JSON.
</p>


<h2>Georgia Institute of Technology</h2>
								<p>
									<br /> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> I worked as a research assistant for the science lab at Georgia Tech in Spring 2015.
									<br /> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Improved the 3D X-ray system which creates 3D bone structure of rats. Upon completion, the current system which only provides static images will be able to produce 3D animations of the rat’s motion. The final goal is to apply this system on human, to save time and reduce cost when we need a 3D animation of patients’ bone structure while they are moving.

<br /> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Designed a treadmill model for rat using force plates. The new model can measure the force applied from each leg of the rat to the ground while it is walking. The model can further detect abnormal motions of human bones, by recognizing uneven strengths/ directions of forces from human’s legs (Matlab, Maya).
